# **2025 Rush Hour Game**

The project was co-created by **Sirui Wang**, **Juntang Huang**, **Jing Qiu**, **Chenxi Shen** and **Yuhan Tian** and will be made publicly available in code soon. Thank you for your interest in this project.

**To ensure a smooth deployment of our software on your system, please follow the steps below. All the operation complete in Windows.**

## Software Overview

Rush Hour is a classic single player sliding block puzzle on a 6Ã—6 grid. The objective is to slide cars and trucks of varying lengths horizontally or vertically to clear a path for the red target car to exit on the right. To enrich gameplay, five modes are available:

- **Classic Mode (*Rush Hour*)** is the standard game without additional constraints.
- **Endless Mode (*Rush Infinity*)** comprises 89 levels of increasing difficulty; completing each level unlocks the next one.
- **Time Limit Mode (*Rush Time*)** requires solving the level within a specified time.
- **Step Limit Mode (*Rush Step*)** requires solving the level within a fixed number of moves.
- **Chaos Mode (*Rush Chaos*)** moves a random vehicle one square along its orientation every five moves.

## **Environment Setup**

To ensure maximum stability, we **strongly recommend** creating a dedicated Python environment for the game.

1. Open **Anaconda Terminal/Command Prompt**;

2. Create a **new environment** named `rushhour`:

   ```bash
   conda create --name rushhour python=3.9
   ```

   (**Hint:** As tested by the developers, you need to have Python version 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 installed.)

3. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate rushhour
   ```

4. Verify that the environment is correctly configured:

   ```bash
   conda info  --envs
   ```

   And you will find the `rushhour` environment and its path.
